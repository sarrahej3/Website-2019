        <p class="paragraph">Step one: go on your iPhone home screen <br>
        Step two: click on the camera<br>
        Step three: slide to portrait mode (with this you can get a clear picture of the main focus in the picture)<br>
        Step four: don't take the picture dead on. Turn your camera at an angle so it isnt dead on.<br>
        You can choose to edit the picture to enhance it or not, it's your choice really. I like to make the pictures more cool toned rather warm. However, when it comes with sign colors I normally never enhance it because the designer made it that way so might as well keep it that way.</p>
