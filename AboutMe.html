    <p>I come from a home where photography and art is huge. My mother had a passion for it when I was young and went to get some degrees. Which in return made myself appreciate pictures enough that I’d follow her around her shoots to take my own. A lot of my pictures consists of nature. The reason being that nature isn’t appreciated as much as it should be. You have a whole world that's around you, take  advantage of that.</p>
